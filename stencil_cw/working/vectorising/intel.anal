    Front-End Bound: 20.8% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant proportion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. Possible
     | reasons include a large code working size, poor code layout (requiring
     | too many memory accesses per cycle to get sufficient instructions to fill
     | four pipeline slots), or microcode assists.

     | Identify slots where no uOps are delivered due to a lack of required
     | resources for accepting more uOps in the back-end of the pipeline. Back-

     | and, once completed, these uOps get retired according to program order.
     | Stalls due to data-cache misses or stalls due to the overloaded divider
     | unit are examples of back-end bound issues.
