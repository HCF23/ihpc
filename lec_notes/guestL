simd single intruction multiple data

there is bottleneck for every piece of code
	what is the limiting resource
	- architect would provide more of it
	- coder would code to avoid it

common bottlenecks
	memory bandwidth
	floating point resources

vectors improve 
	ALU use
	efficient use of memory bandwidth
		have their own registers
		frees up reaources elsewhere
	note parallel still uses machine resources
		so save time not machine usage

instead of load n elements one by one
load n

float const restrict * x
- says to compiler "i wont alias vars"
	ie pass in a var called x
		to a function(arg x)

align your data

omp simd
	omp simd aligned
		give info
	-fopenmp-simd
	omp simd (#pragma omp simd)
